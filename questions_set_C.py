Shadows, lines, and faded text are often caused by a failing printhead.\n\n- **Fuser assembly** is responsible for fixing toner to the paper and typically causes smudging when faulty, not lines or fading.\n- **Pickup rollers** handle paper feeding, and their failure leads to paper jams, not print quality issues.\n- **Carriage belt** moves the printhead, but its failure would cause movement issues, not printing defects."

    "question": "A SOHO user's network printer has been without power for the last few days. After turning the printer back on, the user cannot connect to it. Which of the following is the most probable cause?",
    "options": [
        "The printer has a static IP address.",
        "The printer has a dynamic IP address.",
        "The printer has an APIPA.",
        "The printer has a public IP address."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [3],
    "description": "The correct answer is The printer has an APIPA. If the printer was turned off and not assigned a new IP address, it might have reverted to an Automatic Private IP Addressing address.\n\n- **Static IP address** would not cause this issue unless there's an IP conflict or misconfiguration.\n- **Dynamic IP address** normally works unless the DHCP server is unavailable.\n- **Public IP address** is rare for internal SOHO printers and would introduce security risks."

    "question": "A technician is reviewing the following network settings for a workstation that is having trouble accessing the internet:\n\nIPv4 address . . . . . . . : 192.168.10.5\nNetmask . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0\nGateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1\n\nWhich of the following is causing the issue?",
    "options": [
        "Networking was not configured using DHCP.",
        "IPv6 should be used instead of IPv4.",
        "The netmask is wrong.",
        "The workstation has the incorrect gateway."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [4],
    "description": "The correct answer is The workstation has the incorrect gateway. The IP address and netmask suggest that the workstation is on the 192.168.10.0 network, while the gateway is set to 192.168.1.1, which is not on the same network.\n\n- **DHCP** configuration isn't relevant because the IP address is within the correct range for the subnet.\n- **IPv6** is not needed if the network is primarily IPv4.\n- **Netmask** of 255.255.255.0 is correct for the 192.168.10.0 subnet."

    "question": "Which of the following best describes the concept of a DHCP lease?",
    "options": [
      "A definition of the scope of addresses to be assigned to a device on the network",
      "A reservation of an IP configuration for a device on the network",
      "A temporary assignment of an IP configuration to a device on the network",
      "A translation of network names to IP addresses for a device on the network"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [3],
    "description": "The correct answer is A temporary assignment of an IP configuration to a device on the network. A DHCP lease refers to the time period during which an IP address is assigned to a device by a DHCP server.\n\n- A definition of the scope relates to the range of IPs available but does not imply assignment.\n- A reservation is for specific devices but not the temporary nature of DHCP leases.\n- A translation of network names relates to DNS, not DHCP."

    "question": "A user arrives at the office and is unable to access the company's network on a smartphone. The user enables Wi-Fi on the smartphone, but it only shows the 5G symbol. Which of the following device settings should the user configure to fix this issue?",
    "options": [
      "Autoconnect",
      "VPN",
      "Encryption",
      "WPS"
    ],
    "correct_answer": [1],
    "description": "The correct answer is Autoconnect. The 5G symbol indicates the device is connected to a mobile network, not Wi-Fi. Enabling Wi-Fi autoconnect might automatically connect the smartphone to the office network.\n\n- VPN is for secure remote access but does not solve connectivity issues.\n- Encryption is necessary for security but does not address connection problems.\n- WPS is used for easy wireless setup, not for connecting to the office network."

    "question": "A technician wants to upgrade a computer to a new Windows version. The Windows Upgrade Advisor states that the computer is not compatible with the new Windows version due to a lack of TPM 2.0 support. Which of the following should the technician do next?",
    "options": [
      "Enable the module in the UEFI BIOS.",
      "Install an HSM in the computer.",
      "Perform a clean install of the new Windows version.",
      "Implement BitLocker on the computer."
    ],
    "correct_answer": [1],
    "description": "The correct answer is Enable the module in the UEFI BIOS. TPM 2.0 must be enabled in the BIOS for the Windows version to be compatible.\n\n- Installing an HSM (Hardware Security Module) is unnecessary if TPM can be enabled.\n- A clean install won't resolve the TPM compatibility issue.\n- Implementing BitLocker requires TPM to be active."
