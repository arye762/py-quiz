Which of the following would BEST help identify the issue?", "options": ["A syslog server", "Change management records", "A rack diagram", "The security log"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is A syslog server. The syslog server can provide logs related to the switchport connection, helping identify why a device cannot connect. \n\n- Change management records might provide insights but are not as direct as syslog data. \n- A rack diagram shows physical placement but doesn't address connection issues. \n- The security log would only be helpful if the issue is security-related."}, {"question": "A company with multiple routers would like to implement an HA network gateway with the least amount of downtime possible. This solution should not require changes on the gateway setting of the network clients. Which of the following should a technician configure?", "options": ["Automate a continuous backup and restore process of the system's state of the active gateway.", "Use a static assignment of the gateway IP address on the network clients.", "Configure DHCP relay and allow clients to receive a new IP setting.", "Configure a shared VIP and deploy VRRP on the routers."], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is Configure a shared VIP and deploy VRRP on the routers. VRRP allows for high availability by providing a virtual IP address (VIP) that clients can use, and if one router fails, another takes over without needing client-side configuration changes. \n\n- Automating backup and restore doesn't prevent downtime in the case of failure. \n- Static IP addresses do not provide high availability. \n- DHCP relay and IP changes aren't ideal for minimizing downtime."}, {"question": "Which of the following protocols would allow a secure connection to a Linux-based system?", "options": ["SMB", "FTP", "RDP", "SSH"], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is SSH. SSH is designed for secure remote connections to systems, including Linux. \n\n- SMB is used for file sharing in Windows environments. \n- FTP is an unencrypted protocol and not secure by default. \n- RDP is for remote desktop access and is generally used in Windows environments."}, {"question": "A network administrator is troubleshooting the communication between two Layer 2 switches that are reporting a very high runt count. After trying multiple ports on both switches, the issue persists. Which of the following should the network administrator perform to resolve the issue?", "options": ["Increase the MTU size on both switches.", "Recertify the cable between both switches.", "Perform a factory reset on both switches.", "Enable debug logging on both switches"], "correct_answer": 2, "description": "The correct answer is Recertify the cable between both switches. A high runt count is often caused by bad cabling, so recertifying the cable can resolve the issue. \n\n- Increasing the MTU size is unlikely to fix runt count problems, as these are typically caused by physical layer issues. \n- A factory reset would not directly address cable or physical layer issues. \n- Debug logging can provide information but is unlikely to resolve the issue."}, {"question": "A technician is troubleshooting a client's report about poor wireless performance. Using a client monitor, the technician notes the following information:\n\nSSID\tSignal (RSSI)\tChannel\nCorporate\t-50\t9\nCorporate\t-69\t10\nCorporate\t-67\t11\nCorporate\t-63\t6\n\nWhich of the following is MOST likely the cause of the issue?", "options": ["Channel overlap.", "Poor signal.", "Incorrect power settings.", "Wrong antenna type."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is channel overlap. The client monitor shows that multiple wireless signals from the same SSID are using adjacent channels (9, 10, 11), which could be causing interference and poor performance. \n\n- Poor signal (RSSI values like -69 and -67) may contribute to the issue, but the primary cause appears to be interference from adjacent channels. \n- Incorrect power settings and wrong antenna type are less likely to cause channel overlap, which is the most common culprit for wireless performance issues."}, {"question": "Users attending security training at work are advised not to use single words as passwords for corporate applications. Which of the following does this BEST protect against?", "options": ["An on-path attack.", "A brute-force attack.", "A dictionary attack.", "MAC spoofing.", "Denial of service."], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is a dictionary attack. Single-word passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks, where attackers use precompiled lists of common words to guess passwords. \n\n- An on-path attack intercepts communication but does not directly exploit weak passwords. \n- A brute-force attack attempts all combinations, but dictionary attacks are more efficient for common words. \n- MAC spoofing and Denial of service are unrelated to password complexity."}, {"question": "A network administrator would like to enable NetFlow on a Layer 3 switch but is concerned about how the feature may impact the switch. Which of the following metrics should the administrator graph using SNMP to BEST measure the feature's impact?", "options": ["CPU usage.", "Temperature.", "Electrical consumption.", "Bandwidth usage."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is CPU usage. Enabling NetFlow can increase the CPU load on the switch due to the extra processing required to monitor and record traffic flows. \n\n- Temperature, electrical consumption, and bandwidth usage are not directly impacted by NetFlow configuration, making them less relevant for measuring the feature's impact."}, {"question": "Which of the following would be used to enforce and schedule critical updates with supervisory approval and include backup plans in case of failure?", "options": ["Business continuity plan.", "Onboarding and offboarding policies.", "Acceptable use policy.", "System life cycle.", "Change management."], "correct_answer": 5, "description": "The correct answer is change management. Change management ensures that updates are scheduled, approved, and have backup plans in case of failure. \n\n- Business continuity plans focus on maintaining operations during disasters, not specifically on updates. \n- Onboarding/offboarding policies and acceptable use policies are not directly related to updating systems. \n- System life cycle outlines the stages of a system but doesn\u2019t focus on update scheduling."}, {"question": "A newly installed VoIP phone is not getting the DHCP IP address it needs to connect to the phone system. Which of the following tasks need to be completed to allow the phone to operate correctly?", "options": ["Assign the phone's switchport to the correct VLAN.", "Statically assign the phone's gateway address.", "Configure a route on the VoIP network router.", "Implement a VoIP gateway."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is assign the phone's switchport to the correct VLAN. VoIP phones rely on proper VLAN configuration to get DHCP addresses and connect to the phone system. \n\n- Statically assigning the gateway address, configuring a route, or implementing a VoIP gateway are less likely to resolve the issue if the VLAN configuration is missing."}, {"question": "Users are reporting intermittent WiFi connectivity in specific parts of a building.

(Choose two.)", "options": ["Site survey.", "EIRP.", "AP placement.", "Captive portal.", "SSID assignment.", "AP association time."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answers are site survey and AP placement. A site survey will help identify coverage gaps, and proper AP placement ensures good signal strength in all areas of the building. \n\n- EIRP measures transmission power, but AP placement is often the more immediate solution. \n- Captive portals and SSID assignment are not primary causes of connectivity issues. \n- AP association time refers to the time it takes to connect, but AP placement is more crucial."}, {"question": "A technician is setting up a new router, configuring ports, and allowing access to the Internet. However, none of the users connected to this new router are able to connect to the Internet. Which of the following does the technician need to configure?", "options": ["Tunneling.", "Multicast routing.", "Network address translation.", "Router advertisement."], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is network address translation (NAT). NAT is required to allow users on the private network to connect to the internet via a public IP address. \n\n- Tunneling and multicast routing are not necessary for this basic connectivity. \n- Router advertisement is used for IPv6 and might not directly affect Internet connectivity."}, {"question": "A network administrator is testing performance improvements by configuring channel bonding on an 802.11ac AP. Although a site survey detected the majority of the 5GHz frequency spectrum was idle, being used only by the company's WLAN and a nearby government radio system, the AP is not allowing the administrator to manually configure a large portion of the 5GHz frequency range. Which of the following would be BEST to configure for the WLAN being tested?", "options": ["Upgrade the equipment to an AP that supports manual configuration of the EIRP power settings.", "Switch to 802.11n, disable channel auto-selection, and enforce channel bonding on the configuration.", "Set up the AP to perform a dynamic selection of the frequency according to regulatory requirements.", "Deactivate the band 5GHz to avoid interference with the government radio."], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is set up the AP to perform a dynamic selection of the frequency according to regulatory requirements. Regulatory constraints may prevent manual selection of certain frequencies, and dynamic frequency selection (DFS) allows the AP to automatically select the best available channel. \n\n- Upgrading equipment or switching to 802.11n might not address regulatory constraints. \n- Deactivating the 5GHz band would reduce bandwidth availability and is not a recommended solution."}, {"question": "Which of the following options represents the participating computers in a network?", "options": ["Nodes.", "CPUs.", "Servers.", "Clients."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is nodes. In networking, nodes refer to devices that participate in the network, such as computers, routers, and switches. \n\n- CPUs refer to the central processing units of computers, not the entire networked device. \n- Servers and clients are specific types of nodes, but 'nodes' is the more general term."}, {"question": "An administrator is working with the local ISP to troubleshoot an issue. Which of the following should the ISP use to define the furthest point on the network that the administrator is responsible for troubleshooting?", "options": ["Firewall.", "A CSU/DSU.", "Demarcation point.", "Router.", "Patch panel."], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is demarcation point. The demarcation point is where responsibility for the network shifts from the ISP to the customer. \n\n- The firewall, CSU/DSU, router, and patch panel are devices that can be involved in troubleshooting but are not used to define responsibility boundaries."}, {"question": "To access production applications and data, developers must first connect remotely to a different server. From there, the developers are able to access production data. Which of the following does this BEST represent?", "options": ["A management plane.", "A proxy server.", "An out-of-band management device.", "A site-to-site VPN.", "A jump box."], "correct_answer": 5, "description": "The correct answer is a jump box. A jump box is a server used to access other servers or networks remotely, typically as an extra security layer. \n\n- A management plane is responsible for managing network devices. \n- A proxy server acts as an intermediary for requests, not for remote access. \n- An out-of-band management device is used for managing devices separately from regular network traffic. \n- A site-to-site VPN is used for secure connections between two sites, not individual device access."}, {"question": "Which of the following is conducted frequently to maintain an updated list of a system's weaknesses?", "options": ["Penetration test.", "Posture assessment.", "Risk assessment.", "Vulnerability scan."], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is vulnerability scan. This tool is used frequently to scan systems for weaknesses and vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. \n\n- A penetration test is more intrusive and typically done less frequently, simulating a real-world attack. \n- A posture assessment evaluates overall security health but is broader in scope. \n- A risk assessment involves evaluating potential threats but not necessarily maintaining a list of weaknesses."}, {"question": "A systems administrator wants to use the least amount of equipment to segment two departments that have cables terminating in the same room. Which of the following would allow this to occur?", "options": ["A load balancer.", "A proxy server.", "A Layer 3 switch.", "A hub.", "A Layer 7 firewall."], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is a Layer 3 switch. A Layer 3 switch can be used to segment traffic between different departments using VLANs while minimizing the need for additional equipment. \n\n- A load balancer is used to distribute traffic evenly across servers, not for segmentation. \n- A proxy server handles requests on behalf of clients but doesn't segment traffic. \n- A hub is a simple device that doesn\u2019t provide segmentation and broadcasts data to all ports. \n- A Layer 7 firewall works on application data, which is not ideal for simple segmentation."}, {"question": "An administrator needs to connect two laptops directly to each other using 802.11ac but does not have an AP available. Which of the following describes this configuration?", "options": ["Basic service set.", "Extended service set.", "Independent basic service set.", "MU-MIMO."], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS). This configuration allows two devices to communicate directly with each other without the need for an access point. \n\n- Basic Service Set (BSS) requires an access point. \n- Extended Service Set (ESS) refers to a network with multiple access points. \n- MU-MIMO is a technology that allows multiple devices to communicate simultaneously, but it does not describe a direct connection between two laptops."}, {"question": "A network administrator is installing a new server in the datacenter. The administrator is concerned the amount of traffic generated will exceed 1GB, and higher-throughput NICs are not available for installation. Which of the following is the BEST solution for this issue?", "options": ["Install an additional NIC and configure LACP.", "Remove some of the applications from the server.", "Configure the NIC to use full duplex.", "Configure port mirroring to send traffic to another server.", "Install an SSD to decrease data processing time."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is install an additional NIC and configure LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol). LACP allows you to combine multiple NICs into a single logical connection, which can increase throughput beyond 1GB. \n\n- Removing applications from the server is not a viable solution for increasing throughput. \n- Configuring the NIC to use full duplex will not increase the total throughput beyond the NIC's physical limits. \n- Port mirroring is used for traffic monitoring, not improving throughput. \n- Installing an SSD will help with data processing speeds but will not address the throughput issue."}, {"question": "A malicious user is using special software to perform an on-path attack. Which of the following best practices should be configured to mitigate this threat?", "options": ["Dynamic ARP inspection.", "Role-based access.", "Control plane policing.", "MAC filtering."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is Dynamic ARP inspection. This helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks by ensuring that only valid ARP requests are processed, mitigating on-path (man-in-the-middle) attacks. \n\n- Role-based access controls are important for limiting permissions but do not specifically protect against on-path attacks. \n- Control plane policing helps manage network traffic but is not directly related to ARP spoofing. \n- MAC filtering is a security measure for restricting device access based on MAC addresses, but it is not as effective against on-path attacks as ARP inspection."}, {"question": "Which of the following can be used to store various types of devices and provide contactless delivery to users?", "options": ["Asset tags.", "Biometrics.", "Access control vestibules.", "Smart lockers."], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is smart lockers. Smart lockers provide a secure way to store devices and allow users to retrieve them via contactless methods, such as using an access code or RFID. \n\n- Asset tags are used for inventory tracking but don't provide contactless delivery. \n- Biometrics are used for identification and access but are not used for storage or delivery. \n- Access control vestibules manage building entry and security but are not designed for device storage or delivery."}, {"question": "A technician recently set up a small office network for nine users. When the installation was complete, all the computers on the network showed addresses ranging from 169.254.0.0 to 169.254.255.255. Which of the following types of address ranges does this represent?", "options": ["Private.", "Public.", "APIPA.", "Classless."], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing). This range (169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255) is automatically assigned by the operating system when a device cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server. \n\n- Private IP addresses are from ranges defined by RFC 1918 and are not in the APIPA range. \n- Public IP addresses are globally routable, but the addresses in question are not. \n- Classless refers to IP address allocation methods that do not use fixed subnets, which is unrelated to APIPA."}, {"question": "Which of the following OSI model layers is where a technician would view UDP information?", "options": ["Physical.", "Data link.", "Network.", "Transport."], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is Transport. UDP (User Datagram Protocol) operates at the Transport layer of the OSI model. This is where connectionless communication protocols are managed. \n\n- The Physical layer deals with the transmission of raw data over physical media. \n- The Data link layer is responsible for node-to-node data transfer, not higher-level protocols like UDP. \n- The Network layer handles routing and addressing, but not UDP traffic."}, {"question": "A network technician at a university is assisting with the planning of a simultaneous software deployment to multiple computers in one classroom in a building. Which of the following would be BEST to use?", "options": ["Multicast.", "Anycast.", "Unicast.", "Broadcast."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is multicast. Multicast allows the technician to send data to a specific group of recipients (multiple computers in the classroom) without flooding the entire network. \n\n- Anycast is used to route traffic to the nearest available server, not for simultaneous deployment. \n- Unicast is a one-to-one communication method, which would not be efficient for multiple machines. \n- Broadcast sends data to all devices on the network, which is not ideal for targeted deployment."}, {"question": "A network administrator is reviewing the following metrics from a network management system regarding a switchport. The administrator suspects an issue because users are calling in regards to the switch port's performance:\n\nMetric                               Value\n-----------------------------------------------\nUptime                              201 days, 3 hours, 18 minutes\nMDIX                               On\nCRCs                                0\nGiants                             2508\nOutput queue maximum          40\nPackets input                     136208849\nPackets output                    64458087024\n\nBased on the information in the chart above, which of the following is the cause of these performance issues?", "options": ["The connected device is exceeding the configured MTU.", "The connected device is sending too many packets.", "The switchport has been up for too long.", "The connected device is receiving too many packets.", "The switchport does not have enough CRCs."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is the connected device is exceeding the configured MTU. The large number of 'Giants' (oversized packets) suggests that the connected device is sending packets larger than the allowed MTU, causing performance issues.\n\n- While the uptime being long can contribute to performance degradation, it is not the root cause.\n- CRCs are zero, indicating no errors on the network, ruling out physical issues.\n- The device receiving too many packets is unlikely to cause 'Giants' or performance issues.\n- CRCs are not the issue here since there are no errors."}, {"question": "Which of the following describes the BEST device to configure as a DHCP relay?", "options": ["Bridge", "Router", "Layer 2 switch", "Hub"], "correct_answer": 2, "description": "The correct answer is a router. A DHCP relay forwards DHCP messages between clients and servers across different networks. \n\n- A bridge simply connects two networks at Layer 2, but doesn't relay DHCP messages. \n- A Layer 2 switch operates at the Data Link Layer and typically does not handle DHCP relay functions. \n- A hub is a basic network device that doesn't have the capability to relay DHCP messages."}, {"question": "Which of the following compromises Internet-connected devices and makes them vulnerable to becoming part of a botnet? (Choose two.)", "options": ["Deauthentication attack", "Malware infection", "IP spoofing", "Firmware corruption", "Use of default credentials", "Dictionary attack"], "correct_answer": [2, 5], "description": "The correct answers are Malware infection and Use of default credentials. Both issues leave devices vulnerable to botnet compromise. \n\n- A deauthentication attack can disrupt communication but does not directly compromise the device. \n- IP spoofing is a method used in attacks but doesn't inherently make devices part of a botnet. \n- Firmware corruption may cause issues, but it doesn't directly contribute to botnet vulnerabilities. \n- Default credentials are often exploited in botnet attacks as attackers easily gain control of devices with unchanged factory settings."}, {"question": "A network administrator is planning a WLAN for a soccer stadium and was advised to use MU-MIMO to improve connection performance in high-density areas.

Which of the following needs to be reconfigured?", "options": ["The IP address", "The subnet mask", "The gateway address", "The DNS servers"], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is the gateway address. The gateway address is required to route traffic between the local network and external resources, such as the internet. \n\n- The IP address is likely correct, as the user can access local resources. \n- The subnet mask is also likely correct since local communication works. \n- DNS servers help resolve domain names but are not responsible for routing traffic outside the local network."}, {"question": "An IT administrator received an assignment with the following objectives:\n\u2711 Conduct a total scan within the company's network for all connected hosts.\n\u2711 Detect all the types of operating systems running on all devices.\n\u2711 Discover all services offered by hosts on the network.\n\u2711 Find open ports and detect security risks.\nWhich of the following command-line tools can be used to achieve these objectives?", "options": ["nmap", "arp", "netstat", "tcpdump"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is nmap. Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool that can discover devices, identify operating systems, and detect open ports and services. \n\n- arp is used for mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses, but it doesn't perform network-wide scans. \n- netstat provides information about current network connections but doesn't perform scans. \n- tcpdump is used to capture and analyze network traffic but does not scan for open ports or services."}, {"question": "A network manager is configuring switches in IDFs to ensure unauthorized client computers are not connecting to a secure wired network. Which of the following is the network manager MOST likely performing?", "options": ["Disabling unneeded switchports", "Changing the default VLAN", "Configuring DHCP snooping", "Writing ACLs to prevent access to the switch"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is disabling unneeded switchports. Disabling unused ports helps prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. \n\n- Changing the default VLAN is more about network organization than security. \n- Configuring DHCP snooping is a security feature for preventing rogue DHCP servers, not unauthorized client connections. \n- ACLs can prevent network access but don't address physical switchport security directly."}, {"question": "At which of the following OSI model layers does routing occur?", "options": ["Data link", "Transport", "Physical", "Network"], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is Network. Routing occurs at the Network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model, where packets are forwarded based on IP addresses. \n\n- Data link layer (Layer 2) deals with MAC addresses and frames, not routing. \n- Transport layer (Layer 4) deals with end-to-end communication and flow control. \n- Physical layer (Layer 1) is concerned with transmitting raw bits over the physical medium."}, {"question": "An auditor assessing network best practices was able to connect a rogue switch into a network jack and get network connectivity.

Port security helps prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network by limiting the number of MAC addresses per port. \n\n- Deactivating Spanning Tree Protocol could lead to network loops and instability, and doesn't prevent unauthorized devices. \n- Disabling Neighbor Resolution Protocol is not related to physical security concerns. \n- Port tagging is more related to VLAN management than physical device security."}, {"question": "A technician knows the MAC address of a device and is attempting to find the device's IP address. Which of the following should the technician look at to find the IP address? (Choose two.)", "options": ["ARP table", "DHCP leases", "IP route table", "DNS cache", "MAC address table", "STP topology"], "correct_answer": [1, 2], "description": "The correct answers are ARP table and DHCP leases. The ARP table maps IP addresses to MAC addresses, and DHCP leases contain the IP addresses assigned to devices. \n\n- The IP route table is used for routing information and doesn't map MAC addresses to IP addresses. \n- DNS cache stores domain name resolutions, not IP addresses for MAC addresses. \n- The MAC address table is for network switches to map MAC addresses to switch ports, not IP addresses. \n- STP topology is for managing network loops and does not relate to IP-MAC address resolution."}, {"question": "A user in a branch office reports that access to all files has been lost after receiving a new PC. All other users in the branch can access fileshares. The IT engineer who is troubleshooting this incident is able to ping the workstation from the branch router, but the machine cannot, ping the router. Which of the following is MOST likely the cause of the incident?", "options": ["Incorrect subnet mask", "Incorrect DNS server", "Incorrect IP class", "Incorrect TCP port"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is Incorrect subnet mask. The subnet mask defines the network portion of the IP address, and if it's incorrect, the computer may not be able to communicate with devices outside its subnet, such as the router. \n\n- The DNS server setting is unrelated to IP address routing and would not affect the ability to ping the router. \n- The IP class relates to the overall network structure but does not typically cause local connectivity issues. \n- TCP ports are used for specific services, not for basic network connectivity issues like this one."}, {"question": "A network administrator would like to purchase a device that provides access ports to endpoints and has the ability to route between networks. Which of the following would be BEST for the administrator to purchase?", "options": ["An IPS", "A Layer 3 switch", "A router", "A wireless LAN controller"], "correct_answer": 2, "description": "The correct answer is a Layer 3 switch. A Layer 3 switch combines the functionality of a traditional switch and a router, allowing it to route traffic between different networks while providing access ports for endpoints. \n\n- An IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) is used for security, not routing. \n- A router can also route traffic, but it typically does not provide direct access ports like a switch. \n- A wireless LAN controller is used for managing wireless access points, not for routing between networks."}, {"question": "A false camera is installed outside a building to assist with physical security. Which of the following is the device assisting?", "options": ["Detection", "Recovery", "Identification", "Prevention"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is Detection. A false camera, although not actively monitoring, can deter potential intruders by creating the appearance of surveillance. Its primary role is to aid in detecting unauthorized activity by intimidating potential threats. \n\n- Recovery refers to systems that help recover from incidents, not prevent or detect them. \n- Identification is about recognizing individuals or objects, which is not the role of a false camera. \n- Prevention refers to devices or systems that directly stop security threats, not just detect them."}, {"question": "Which of the following types of attacks can be used to gain credentials by setting up rogue APs with identical corporate SSIDs?", "options": ["VLAN hopping", "Evil twin", "DNS poisoning", "Social engineering"], "correct_answer": 2, "description": "The correct answer is Evil twin. An evil twin attack involves setting up rogue access points (APs) with the same SSID as a legitimate corporate network, tricking users into connecting to them and revealing credentials. \n\n- VLAN hopping is an attack on VLAN configurations, not related to rogue APs. \n- DNS poisoning targets domain name systems, not wireless networks. \n- Social engineering involves manipulating people to disclose information, which is different from exploiting network vulnerabilities."}, {"question": "Which of the following protocols is widely used in large-scale enterprise networks to support complex networks with multiple routers and balance traffic load on multiple links?", "options": ["OSPF", "RIPv2", "QoS", "STP"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is OSPF. Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is a widely used routing protocol in large-scale networks due to its scalability and ability to balance traffic across multiple links. \n\n- RIPv2 is an older protocol, less efficient for large networks. \n- QoS (Quality of Service) is used to manage bandwidth, not to balance traffic load across links. \n- STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) prevents loops in Ethernet networks but does not balance traffic."}, {"question": "A network engineer is investigating reports of poor network performance.
