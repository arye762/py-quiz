The network administrator is unable to use SSH to connect to the switch but is able to gain access using the serial console port. While monitoring port statistics, the administrator sees the following:\n\nMetric                        | Value            | Metric                    | Value\n--------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------\nTotal Rx (bps)                 | 23,041,464       | Total Tx (bps)            | 621,032\nUnicast Rx (Pkts/sec)          | 102,465          | Unicast Tx (Pkts/sec)     | 66\nB/Mcast Rx (Pkts/sec)          | 21,456,465       | B/Mcast Tx (Pkts/sec)     | 7\nUtilization Rx                 | 2.3%             | Utilization Tx            | 0.06%\n\nWhich of the following is MOST likely causing the network outage?", "options": ["Duplicate IP address", "High collisions", "Asynchronous route", "Switch loop"], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is Switch loop. The statistics show a high number of broadcast/multicast packets (21,456,465 received vs. only 7 transmitted), which is characteristic of a switch loop. In a switch loop, broadcast packets continuously circulate through the network, overwhelming resources and causing a network outage. \n\n- A duplicate IP address would cause network issues but would not generate high numbers of broadcast packets.\n- High collisions would affect data transmission but wouldn't produce the high number of broadcast packets shown here.\n- An asynchronous route is unrelated to broadcast traffic and would typically cause routing issues rather than a complete communication failure."}], "image_enabled": false, "wrong_questions": []}
