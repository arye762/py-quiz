This method allows users to access internal web applications directly from a browser without installing additional software, providing high flexibility and compatibility while encrypting only the web application's connection. \n\n- Virtual desktop offers broader access but requires additional setup and is less focused on single applications. \n- Virtual network computing provides remote desktop functionality but does not encrypt connections by default. \n- mGRE tunnel is designed for site-to-site connections, not for individual user application access."}, {"question": "A network engineer receives the following when connecting to a switch to configure a port: telnet 10.1.200.1\nConnecting to 10.1.200.1..Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed.\nWhich of the following is the MOST likely cause for the failure?", "options": ["The network engineer is using the wrong protocol.", "The network engineer does not have permission to configure the device.", "SNMP has been secured with an ACL.", "The switchport the engineer is trying to configure is down."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is that the network engineer is using the wrong protocol. Telnet uses port 23, which may be disabled on modern systems in favor of more secure protocols like SSH. \n\n- Permissions issues would not typically result in a port error. \n- SNMP with ACLs does not impact Telnet connectivity. \n- A down switchport would affect connected devices but not Telnet's ability to connect to the host itself."}, {"question": "A network attack caused a network outage by wiping the configuration and logs of the border firewall.

Syslog servers collect detailed log data from devices, including configuration changes and security events, making them the best source for forensic analysis. \n\n- The MIB contains management data but lacks event logs. \n- Network baseline reports help compare normal and abnormal traffic but do not provide detailed logs. \n- NetFlow data aggregates traffic flow but does not contain configuration or log details."}, {"question": "A network engineer needs to reduce the overhead of file transfers. Which of the following configuration changes would accomplish that goal?", "options": ["Link aggregation", "Jumbo frames", "Port security", "Flow control", "Lower FTP port"], "correct_answer": 2, "description": "The correct answer is Jumbo frames. Jumbo frames increase the maximum transmission unit (MTU), reducing overhead by allowing more data to be sent per packet, which improves efficiency in file transfers. \n\n- Link aggregation increases bandwidth but does not directly reduce overhead. \n- Port security relates to access control, not file transfer efficiency. \n- Flow control manages traffic but does not reduce packet overhead. \n- Lowering the FTP port is unrelated to overhead reduction."}, {"question": "Which of the following devices have the capability to allow communication between two different subnetworks?

Both devices operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model, enabling communication between different subnetworks by routing packets based on IP addresses. \n\n- IDS is a monitoring tool, not a routing device. \n- Access points provide wireless connectivity but do not route traffic between subnetworks. \n- Layer 2 switches operate at the Data Link Layer and cannot route packets between subnetworks. \n- Media converters change the transmission medium but do not facilitate inter-subnet communication."}, {"question": "A network technician is implementing a solution that will allow end users to gain access to multiple applications after logging on. Which of the following authentication methods would allow this type of access?", "options": ["SSO", "LDAP", "EAP", "TACACS+"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is SSO (Single Sign-On). SSO allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications or systems without needing to log in again, enhancing user experience and productivity. \n\n- LDAP is a protocol for accessing directory services, not for unified authentication. \n- EAP is primarily used for wireless authentication. \n- TACACS+ is focused on centralized device management, not end-user application access."}, {"question": "An administrator is attempting to add a new system to monitoring but is unsuccessful.

Updated MIBs provide compatibility with the new system's OS version, ensuring proper communication with monitoring tools. \n\n- Updating the system baseline involves performance standards, not monitoring compatibility. \n- Network device logs contain historical data but do not impact monitoring capabilities. \n- SNMP traps send alerts but are not related to MIB updates."}, {"question": "A network technician receives a report about a performance issue on a client PC that is connected to port 1/3 on a network switch.

The speed setting for port 1/3 is only 10 Mbps, while other ports are set to 1000 Mbps. This mismatch can cause significant performance degradation for devices connected to port 1/3. \n\n- Duplex is correctly set to Full, so it is not the cause of the issue. \n- Errors indicate potential transmission issues but are not directly linked to the observed configuration. \n- VLAN configuration is unrelated to port speed."}, {"question": "Which of the following would be used when connecting devices that have different physical characteristics?", "options": ["A proxy server", "An industrial control system", "A load balancer", "A media converter"], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is Media Converter. Media converters are used to connect devices with different physical media, such as converting fiber optics to copper. \n\n- Proxy servers are used for managing network traffic, not physical connections. \n- Industrial control systems are used for automation, not connecting devices with different media. \n- Load balancers distribute network traffic but do not resolve physical connection differences."}, {"question": "A Fortune 500 firm is deciding on the kind of data center equipment to install given its five-year budget outlook.
