Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of the issue?",
    "options": [
        "The user’s internet connection is down.",
        "The user’s domain account is locked out.",
        "The user’s switch has stopped working.",
        "The user’s IP address needs to be renewed."
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "description": "To address the connectivity issue:\n\n- **The internet connection being down** is the most probable cause, as the user can access local resources but cannot reach external servers or websites.\n- **Domain account lockouts** would prevent access to network resources but wouldn't necessarily explain the limited connectivity message.\n- **Switch malfunction** is unlikely if the user can still access local machines.\n- **IP address renewal** might help, but it’s less likely to be the main issue if local access is still available."
