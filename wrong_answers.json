[{"question": "An auditor assessing network best practices was able to connect a rogue switch into a network jack and get network connectivity. Which of the following controls would BEST address this risk?", "options": ["Activate port security on the switchports providing end user access.", "Deactivate Spanning Tree Protocol on network interfaces that are facing public areas.", "Disable Neighbor Resolution Protocol in the Layer 2 devices.", "Ensure port tagging is in place for network interfaces in guest areas."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is to activate port security on the switchports providing end user access. Port security helps prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network by limiting the number of MAC addresses per port. \n\n- Deactivating Spanning Tree Protocol could lead to network loops and instability, and doesn't prevent unauthorized devices. \n- Disabling Neighbor Resolution Protocol is not related to physical security concerns. \n- Port tagging is more related to VLAN management than physical device security."}, {"question": "Wireless users are reporting intermittent internet connectivity. Connectivity is restored when the users disconnect and reconnect, utilizing the web authentication process each time. The network administrator can see the devices connected to the APs at all times. Which of the following steps will MOST likely determine the cause of the issue?", "options": ["Verify the session time-out configuration on the captive portal settings", "Check for encryption protocol mismatch on the client's wireless settings", "Confirm that a valid passphrase is being used during the web authentication", "Investigate for a client's disassociation caused by an evil twin AP"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is to verify the session time-out configuration on the captive portal settings. Misconfigured session timeouts can force users to reauthenticate frequently. \n\n- Encryption protocol mismatches typically prevent connection entirely, not intermittently. \n- A valid passphrase is necessary but unrelated to recurring session drops. \n- Evil twin AP attacks cause disconnections but would also require user action or rogue devices, which is not indicated here."}, {"question": "Which of the following is the MOST appropriate use case for the deployment of a clientless VPN?", "options": ["Secure web access to internal corporate resources.", "Upgrade security via the use of an NFV technology.", "Connect two datacenters across the Internet.", "Increase VPN availability by using a SDWAN technology."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is to secure web access to internal corporate resources. A clientless VPN allows secure access via a web browser without needing specialized client software. \n\n- NFV (Network Functions Virtualization) is not directly related to clientless VPNs. \n- Connecting datacenters across the Internet typically requires a different type of VPN, not clientless. \n- SD-WAN improves availability but is not specifically related to clientless VPN use."}, {"question": "A network manager is configuring switches in IDFs to ensure unauthorized client computers are not connecting to a secure wired network. Which of the following is the network manager MOST likely performing?", "options": ["Disabling unneeded switchports", "Changing the default VLAN", "Configuring DHCP snooping", "Writing ACLs to prevent access to the switch"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is disabling unneeded switchports. Disabling unused ports helps prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network. \n\n- Changing the default VLAN is more about network organization than security. \n- Configuring DHCP snooping is a security feature for preventing rogue DHCP servers, not unauthorized client connections. \n- ACLs can prevent network access but don't address physical switchport security directly."}, {"question": "A network engineer is investigating reports of poor network performance. Upon reviewing a device configuration, the engineer finds that duplex settings are mismatched on both ends. Which of the following would be the MOST likely result of this finding?", "options": ["Increased CRC errors.", "Increased giants and runts.", "Increased switching loops.", "Increased device temperature."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is Increased CRC errors. Duplex mismatches can cause excessive collisions and packet retransmissions, leading to CRC errors. \n\n- Giants and runts refer to abnormal packet sizes but are not directly linked to duplex mismatches. \n- Switching loops are caused by incorrect Layer 2 topology configurations, not duplex mismatches. \n- Increased device temperature is unrelated to network configuration issues."}, {"question": "Which of the following would be BEST to use to detect a MAC spoofing attack?", "options": ["Internet Control Message Protocol", "Reverse Address Resolution Protocol", "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol", "Internet Message Access Protocol"], "correct_answer": 2, "description": "The correct answer is Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP). This protocol helps map MAC addresses to IP addresses, which can assist in identifying inconsistencies caused by MAC spoofing. \n\n- ICMP is used for network diagnostics, not detecting MAC spoofing. \n- DHCP assigns IP addresses dynamically but does not directly detect spoofing. \n- IMAP is unrelated to network layer security."}, {"question": "Which of the following would be used to enforce and schedule critical updates with supervisory approval and include backup plans in case of failure?", "options": ["Business continuity plan.", "Onboarding and offboarding policies.", "Acceptable use policy.", "System life cycle.", "Change management."], "correct_answer": 5, "description": "The correct answer is change management. Change management ensures that updates are scheduled, approved, and have backup plans in case of failure. \n\n- Business continuity plans focus on maintaining operations during disasters, not specifically on updates. \n- Onboarding/offboarding policies and acceptable use policies are not directly related to updating systems. \n- System life cycle outlines the stages of a system but doesn\u2019t focus on update scheduling."}, {"question": "A network technician at a university is assisting with the planning of a simultaneous software deployment to multiple computers in one classroom in a building. Which of the following would be BEST to use?", "options": ["Multicast.", "Anycast.", "Unicast.", "Broadcast."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is multicast. Multicast allows the technician to send data to a specific group of recipients (multiple computers in the classroom) without flooding the entire network. \n\n- Anycast is used to route traffic to the nearest available server, not for simultaneous deployment. \n- Unicast is a one-to-one communication method, which would not be efficient for multiple machines. \n- Broadcast sends data to all devices on the network, which is not ideal for targeted deployment."}, {"question": "A network administrator is reviewing the following metrics from a network management system regarding a switchport.

The large number of 'Giants' (oversized packets) suggests that the connected device is sending packets larger than the allowed MTU, causing performance issues.\n\n- While the uptime being long can contribute to performance degradation, it is not the root cause.\n- CRCs are zero, indicating no errors on the network, ruling out physical issues.\n- The device receiving too many packets is unlikely to cause 'Giants' or performance issues.\n- CRCs are not the issue here since there are no errors."}, {"question": "A systems administrator needs to improve WiFi performance in a densely populated office tower and use the latest standard.
