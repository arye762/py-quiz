[{"question": "Which of the following will reduce routing table lookups by performing packet forwarding decisions independently of the network layer header?", "options": ["MPLS", "mGRE", "EIGRP", "VRRP"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is MPLS. It uses labels for packet forwarding, bypassing the need for routing table lookups, which improves efficiency. \n\n- mGRE is used for dynamic tunneling, not routing optimization. \n- EIGRP is a routing protocol and does not bypass routing table lookups. \n- VRRP is used for router redundancy, not packet forwarding optimization.", "image": null}, {"question": "Which of the following records can be used to track the number of changes on a DNS zone?", "options": ["SOA", "SRV", "PTR", "NS"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is SOA (Start of Authority). The SOA record contains information about the DNS zone, including the serial number, which can be used to track changes. \n\n- SRV, PTR, and NS records are used for specific network services and domain name resolutions but do not track DNS zone changes."}, {"question": "A network administrator corrected a rule on a misconfigured firewall. Which of the following should the administrator do NEXT when applying the network troubleshooting methodology?", "options": ["Verify full system functionality.", "Document actions and lessons learned.", "Establish a theory of probable cause.", "Identify potential effects."], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is verify full system functionality. After correcting a firewall rule, the next step is to verify that the system is functioning as expected and that the issue has been resolved. \n\n- Documenting actions and lessons learned should occur after confirming the system's functionality. \n- Establishing a theory of probable cause and identifying potential effects are steps in earlier stages of the troubleshooting process."}, {"question": "Users are reporting performance issues when attempting to access the main fileshare server. Which of the following steps should a network administrator perform NEXT based on the network troubleshooting methodology?", "options": ["Implement a fix to resolve the connectivity issues.", "Determine if anything has changed.", "Establish a theory of probable cause.", "Document all findings, actions, and lessons learned."], "correct_answer": 2, "description": "The correct answer is determine if anything has changed. Before implementing a fix, the network administrator should check for recent changes that may have impacted the server's performance. \n\n- Implementing a fix without understanding the root cause could be premature. \n- Establishing a theory of probable cause happens earlier in the troubleshooting process. \n- Documenting findings occurs after the issue has been resolved."}, {"question": "A network administrator is checking to see if anything has changed. Which of the following steps of the troubleshooting methodology is involved?", "options": ["Identify the problem.", "Test the theory.", "Establish a theory.", "Document findings."], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is to establish a theory. In troubleshooting, after identifying the problem, the technician formulates a theory of what could have changed or caused the issue. \n\n- Identifying the problem is done at the start of the troubleshooting process. \n- Testing the theory occurs after formulating a hypothesis. \n- Documenting findings happens at the end of the troubleshooting process."}, {"question": "An IT administrator needs to connect older smart-plug devices to the network. The administrator wants to prevent future issues from occurring by using an 802.11 standard that only operates on the 2.4GHz frequency. Which of the following standards should the administrator choose?", "options": ["802.11a", "802.11ac", "802.11ax", "802.11b"], "correct_answer": 4, "description": "The correct answer is 802.11b. This standard operates exclusively on the 2.4GHz frequency and would be ideal for the older smart-plug devices. \n\n- 802.11a operates on the 5GHz frequency, making it incompatible with the requirement for 2.4GHz. \n- 802.11ac and 802.11ax support dual-band frequencies (2.4GHz and 5GHz), but are more advanced and may not be needed for older devices."}, {"question": "Which of the following authentication protocols should be used when securing a basic wireless network? (Choose two.)", "options": ["WPA2", "RDP", "WPA", "SSL", "SNMP", "EAP"], "correct_answer": [1, 6], "description": "The correct answers are WPA2 and EAP. WPA2 is the industry standard for wireless security, while EAP provides flexible authentication mechanisms. \n\n- RDP is for remote desktop connections, not wireless security. \n- WPA is an older protocol with weaker security than WPA2. \n- SSL secures web traffic but is unrelated to wireless authentication. \n- SNMP is for network management, not authentication."}, {"question": "Which of the following are the most likely reasons voltage calculations are made before installing equipment? (Choose two.)", "options": ["To ensure equipment is not damaged", "To send reports for compliance regulations", "To speed up the installation process", "To ensure compatibility", "To meet legal requirements", "To ensure the grounding is being maintained"], "correct_answer": [1, 4], "description": "The correct answers are To ensure equipment is not damaged and To ensure compatibility. Calculating voltage prevents damage to sensitive equipment and ensures it operates within specified ranges. \n\n- Compliance regulations may require reporting but are not directly tied to voltage. \n- Speeding up installation is unrelated to electrical safety. \n- Legal requirements rarely focus on voltage calculations. \n- Grounding is critical but distinct from voltage calculations."}, {"question": "A company is sending a switch to a remote site to be reused. An administrator needs to move the switch and ensure no network settings persist. Which of the following databases does the administrator need to delete?", "options": ["VLAN", "STP", "ARP", "Trunking"], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is ARP. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) table stores the mappings between IP addresses and MAC addresses, which are dynamically learned and not intended to persist. \n\n- VLAN configurations define network segments and are needed for network segmentation, so deleting them would be inappropriate. \n- STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) and Trunking configurations relate to network loop prevention and VLAN management but do not need to be cleared for a fresh setup."}, {"question": "Which of the following routing protocols uses attributes to select the best path?", "options": ["EIGRP", "BGP", "OSPF", "RIP"], "correct_answer": 2, "description": "The correct answer is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). BGP is a path vector protocol that uses attributes such as AS path, next-hop, and local preference to determine the best path. \n\n- EIGRP uses a distance-vector algorithm and is not based solely on attributes like BGP. \n- OSPF uses link-state information and does not use path attributes to select routes. \n- RIP is based on hop count and does not use attributes for route selection."}, {"question": "A consultant is working with two international companies. The companies will be sharing cloud resources for a project. Which of the following documents would provide an agreement on how to utilize the resources?", "options": ["MOU", "NDA", "AUP", "SLA"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is MOU (Memorandum of Understanding). An MOU outlines the terms of collaboration and resource sharing between organizations. \n\n- An NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) focuses on confidentiality but doesn't specify resource usage. \n- An AUP (Acceptable Use Policy) defines acceptable usage of resources but doesn't focus on intercompany collaboration. \n- An SLA (Service Level Agreement) specifies the level of service but is not the right document for outlining resource-sharing terms."}, {"question": "A network administrator connects two unmanaged switches together with a straight-through Ethernet cable. The administrator reviews the connection and notices that the uplinks are not on. Which of the following options offers the best solution for the issue?", "options": ["A rollover cable needs to be used", "The switches needs to be rebooted after connecting", "The ports need to be enabled", "The ports need the IP address configured", "A crossover cable needs to be used"], "correct_answer": 5, "description": "The correct answer is a crossover cable. When connecting two switches directly, a crossover cable is required to ensure correct transmission and reception of data. \n\n- A rollover cable is used for console connections, not for connecting switches. \n- Rebooting the switches is unnecessary if the correct cable is used. \n- Enabling ports is important but would not resolve the issue of incorrect cabling. \n- Assigning an IP address is unnecessary for direct switch-to-switch connections."}, {"question": "A user reports that the internet seems slow on a workstation, but no other users have reported any issues. The server team confirms the servers are functioning normally. A technician suspects something specific to the user's computer is overutilizing bandwidth. Which of the following commands should the technician use to further investigate the issue?", "options": ["nmap", "tcpdump", "netstat", "nslookup"], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is netstat. The netstat command can show active network connections and which processes may be using bandwidth on the workstation. \n\n- nmap is a network scanning tool, not designed for troubleshooting bandwidth usage. \n- tcpdump is used for packet capture, which may be overkill for this issue. \n- nslookup is used for DNS queries, not network usage."}, {"question": "Which of the following is associated with the session layer of the OSI model?", "options": ["Data representation", "Packets", "Sockets", "Frames"], "correct_answer": 3, "description": "The correct answer is 'Sockets'. Sockets are an abstraction of the session layer in the OSI model, which establishes and manages communication sessions between devices. \n\n- 'Data representation' is part of the presentation layer, not the session layer. \n- 'Packets' are associated with the network layer. \n- 'Frames' are part of the data link layer, responsible for physical transmission and error detection."}, {"question": "Clients have reported slowness between a branch and a hub location. The senior engineer suspects asymmetrical routing is causing the issue. Which of the following should the engineer run on both the source and the destination network devices to validate this theory?", "options": ["traceroute", "ping", "route", "nslookup"], "correct_answer": 1, "description": "The correct answer is 'traceroute'. The 'traceroute' command helps identify the path that packets take between the source and destination, which can confirm if asymmetrical routing is occurring. \n\n- 'ping' checks connectivity but does not provide information about the route taken. \n- 'route' displays the local routing table but does not trace the actual packet path. \n- 'nslookup' is used for DNS queries and does not provide routing information."}, {"question": "A network administrator receives a call about a network printer that is not working for a workstation. The network administrator verifies the printer is turned on. Given the following information: \nRouter's gateway IP: 10.0.0.1/25 \nDevice: Printer - IP Address: 10.1.0.60 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.128 \nDevice: Workstation - IP address 10.0.0.126 Subnet mask 255.255.255.192 \nWhich of the following should the administrator change to remediate this issue? (Choose two.)", "options": ["The subnet on the router", "The IP address on the printer", "The subnet on the printer", "The IP address on the router", "The subnet on the workstation", "The IP address on the workstation"], "correct_answer": [3, 5], "description": "The correct answers are 'The subnet on the workstation' and 'The subnet on the printer.' The workstation and printer are currently in different subnets, which prevents communication. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation: \n\n1. **Workstation Analysis:**\n   - The workstation IP is 10.0.0.126, and its subnet mask is 255.255.255.192 (/26).\n   - With this subnet mask, the workstation belongs to the network 10.0.0.64/26, which has a usable IP range of 10.0.0.65 to 10.0.0.126. The last usable IP is 10.0.0.126, where the workstation is currently assigned.\n   - This network does not include the router gateway IP (10.0.0.1), which belongs to the 10.0.0.0/25 network. The workstation\u2019s subnet needs to be corrected to match the router\u2019s subnet.\n\n2. **Printer Analysis:**\n   - The printer IP is 10.1.0.60, and its subnet mask is 255.255.255.128 (/25).\n   - This subnet places the printer in the 10.1.0.0/25 network, which has a usable range of 10.1.0.1 to 10.1.0.126.\n   - The printer's network does not match the router\u2019s network (10.0.0.0/25), making it unreachable for the workstation. To resolve this, the printer's IP and subnet must be updated to match the router\u2019s network.\n\n3. **Summary of Fixes:**\n   - The workstation's subnet mask must be updated to 255.255.255.128 (/25) so it aligns with the router\u2019s network.\n   - The printer's IP address and/or subnet mask must also be updated to fall within the same 10.0.0.0/25 network.\n\n- **Router's Configuration:** The router\u2019s IP and subnet are correct (10.0.0.1/25), so no changes are needed here.\n- **IP Address on the Workstation/Printer:** Changing the IP address alone without fixing the subnet mask would still result in communication failure. The subnet mask adjustment ensures they share the same network."}, {"question": "A network engineer is installing APs for a SOHO where every staff member uses a cordless phone.
